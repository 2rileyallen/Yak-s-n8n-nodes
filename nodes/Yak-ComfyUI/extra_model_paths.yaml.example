# ComfyUI Extra Model Paths Configuration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file into your main ComfyUI installation folder
#    (e.g., /Software/ComfyUI/).
# 2. Rename the copied file to "extra_model_paths.yaml".
# 3. Edit the TWO placeholder paths below to match your system.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------


# This entry points to the managed models required for the Yak n8n workflows.
# This file now controls BOTH where ComfyUI looks for these models AND where
# the manage_models.py script downloads and stores them.
#
# You MUST update the "base_path" to the absolute path of the FOLDER where
# you want the "managed_models" directory to be created. This can be on any drive.
#
# EXAMPLE: If you set base_path to "D:\My_AI_Stuff\", the script will create
# and manage models inside "D:\My_AI_Stuff\managed_models\".
